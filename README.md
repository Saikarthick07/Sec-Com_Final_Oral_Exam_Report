  Contains the presentation slides with speaker notes and an embedded system architecture diagram.

## üéØ Objective
The goal of this presentation is to explain how to strengthen **security and compliance** in a cloud-native, microservices-based pet store application by leveraging industry standards and cloud-native tools.

## üèó Architecture Overview
The Algonquin Pet Store application is built using a microservices architecture. Services communicate via APIs and messaging queues. The architecture leverages cloud platforms for scalability, reliability, and security.

## üîë Topics Covered
1. **Architecture Overview**  
   Understanding the Pet Store's system diagram and data flows.  
2. **SSO & Federated Identity Management**  
   Implementing authentication using Azure AD, AWS Cognito, or GCP Identity.  
3. **Audit Logs & Event Analysis**  
   Logging user actions and analyzing with Azure Monitor, AWS CloudWatch, or GCP Cloud Logging.  
4. **Threat Detection in Audit Logs**  
   Configuring alerts using Azure Sentinel, AWS GuardDuty, or GCP Security Command Center.  
5. **Cloud-Native Security Tools**  
   Leveraging Azure Security Center, AWS Inspector, and GCP Security Health Analytics.  
6. **Organizational Policy Enforcement**  
   Defining access and compliance rules via Azure Policy, AWS IAM SCPs, or GCP Organization Policies.  
7. **Security Automation**  
   Automating incident response using Azure Sentinel Playbooks, AWS Lambda, or GCP Cloud Functions.  
8. **Best Practices & Summary**  
   Summarizing improvements in compliance, monitoring, and automation.
